# Blockchain Commons Deterministic CBOR ("dCBOR") for Rust

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Wolf McNally_

---

`dcbor` is a [CBOR](https://cbor.io) codec that focuses on writing and parsing "deterministic" CBOR per [§4.2 of RFC-8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-deterministically-encoded-c). It does not support parts of the spec forbidden by deterministic CBOR (such as indefinite length arrays and maps). It is strict in both what it writes and reads: in particular it will return decoding errors if variable-length integers are not encoded in their minimal form, or CBOR map keys are not in lexicographic order, or there is extra data past the end of the decoded CBOR item.

## Getting Started

```toml
[dependencies]
dcbor = "0.16.1"
```

## Specification

The current specification of the norms and practices guiding the creation of this implementation are currently found in this IETF Internet Draft: [draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/).

## Status - Community Review

`dcbor`  is currently in a community review stage. We would appreciate your consideration and/or testing of the libraries. Obviously, let us know if you find any mistakes or problems. But also let us know if the API meets your needs, if the functionality is easy to use, if the usage of Rust feels properly standardized, and if the library solves any problems you are encountering when doing this kind of coding. Also let us know how it could be improved and what else you'd need for this to be just right for your usage. Comments can be posted [to the Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116).

Because this library is still in a community review stage, it should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
