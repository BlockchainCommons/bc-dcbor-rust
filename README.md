# Blockchain Commons Deterministic CBOR ("dCBOR") for Rust

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Wolf McNally_

---

`dcbor` is a [CBOR](https://cbor.io) codec that focuses on writing and parsing "deterministic" CBOR per [§4.2 of RFC-8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-deterministically-encoded-c). It does not support parts of the spec forbidden by deterministic CBOR (such as indefinite length arrays and maps). It also does not currently support encoding or decoding floating point values. It is strict in both what it writes and reads: in particular it will throw decoding errors if variable-length integers are not encoded in their minimal form, or CBOR map keys are not in lexicographic order, or there is extra data past the end of the decoded CBOR item.

## Gordian Principles

`dcbor` is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** `how does it demonstrate independence`
* **Privacy.** `how does it demonstrate privacy`
* **Resilience.** `how does it demonstrate resilience`
* **Openness.** `how does it demonstrate openness`

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

## Status - Alpha

`dcbor`  is currently under active development and in the alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing. See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).
