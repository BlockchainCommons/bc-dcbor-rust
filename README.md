# Blockchain Commons Deterministic CBOR ("dCBOR") for Rust

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Wolf McNally_

---

`dcbor` implements the dCBOR application profile defined in the IETF Internet Draft [draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/). The dCBOR application profile first requires conformance to CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE) rules, which include:

- Integers must use their shortest possible representation
- Floating-point numbers must use their shortest possible representation
- Map keys must be sorted in bytewise lexicographic order
- Indefinite-length items are not allowed

On top of CDE, dCBOR adds these additional rules:

- Maps must not contain duplicate keys
- Numeric reduction: floating-point values that can be represented as integers in the range [-2^63, 2^64-1] must be encoded as integers
- All NaN values must be reduced to a single canonical representation (quiet NaN with half-width representation 0xf97e00)
- Only certain "simple values" are allowed: false (0xf4), true (0xf5), null (0xf6), and floating-point values
- Text strings must be in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC)

dCBOR encoders must only emit CBOR conforming to these rules, and dCBOR decoders must validate that encoded CBOR conforms to these requirements.

This deterministic approach ensures that semantically equivalent data items are encoded into identical byte streams, which is essential for applications requiring cryptographic verification, content-based addressing, and consistent hashing.

## Getting Started

```toml
[dependencies]
dcbor = "0.17.0"
```

## Status - Production-Ready

`dcbor` is now considered production-ready. The specification has been implemented by multiple third parties and extensively discussed in the IETF CBOR working group. The library provides a stable API that follows the dCBOR application profile.

We still welcome your feedback about the library. Let us know if the API meets your needs, if the functionality is easy to use, if the usage of Rust feels properly standardized, and if the library solves any problems you are encountering when doing this kind of coding. Comments can be posted [to the Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116).

See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                       |
