            dCBOR: A Deterministic CBOR Application Profile
                  draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor-12

Abstract

   The purpose of determinism is to ensure that semantically equivalent
   data items are encoded into identical byte streams.  CBOR (RFC 8949)
   defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in its Section 4.2, but
   leaves some important choices up to the application developer.  The
   CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE) Internet Draft builds on
   this by specifying a baseline for application profiles that wish to
   implement deterministic encoding with CBOR.  The present document
   provides an application profile "dCBOR" that can be used to help
   achieve interoperable deterministic encoding based on CDE for a
   variety of applications wishing an even narrower and clearly defined
   set of choices.

1.  Introduction

   CBOR [RFC8949] has many advantages over other data serialization
   formats.  One of its strengths is specifications and guidelines for
   serializing data deterministically, such that multiple agents
   serializing the same data automatically achieve consensus on the
   exact byte-level form of that serialized data.  This is particularly
   useful when data must be compared for semantic equivalence by
   comparing the hash of its contents.

   Nonetheless, determinism is an opt-in feature of CBOR, and most
   existing CBOR codecs put the primary burden of correct deterministic
   serialization and validation of deterministic encoding during
   deserialization on the engineer.  Furthermore, the specification
   leaves a number of important decisions around determinism up to the
   application developer.  The CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE)
   Internet Draft [CDE] builds on the basic CBOR specification by
   providing a baseline for application profiles that wish to implement
   deterministic encoding with CBOR.

   This document narrows CDE further into a set of requirements for the
   application profile "dCBOR".  These requirements include but go
   beyond CDE, including requiring that dCBOR decoders validate that
   encoded CDE conforms to the requirements of this document.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Application Profile

   The dCBOR Application Profile specifies the use of Deterministic
   Encoding as defined in [CDE] and adds several exclusions and
   reductions specified in this section.

   Just as CDE does not "fork" CBOR, the rules specified here do not
   "fork" CDE: A dCBOR implementation produces well-formed,
   deterministically encoded CDE according to [CDE], and existing CBOR
   or CDE decoders will therefore be able to decode it.  Similarly, CBOR
   or CDE encoders will be able to produce valid dCBOR if handed dCBOR
   conforming data model level information from an application.

   Note that the separation between standard CBOR or CDE processing and
   the processing required by the dCBOR application profile is a
   conceptual one: Both dCBOR processing and standard CDE/CBOR
   processing may be combined into a unified dCBOR/CDE/CBOR codec.  The
   requirements in this document apply to encoding or decoding of dCBOR
   data, regardless of whether the codec is a unified dCBOR/CDE/CBOR
   codec operating in dCBOR-compliant modes, or a single-purpose dCBOR
   codec.  Both of these are generically referred to as "dCBOR codecs"
   in this document.

   This application profile is intended to be used in conjunction with
   an application, which typically will use a subset of CDE/CBOR, which
   in turn influences which subset of the application profile is used.
   As a result, this application profile places no direct requirement on
   what subset of CDE/CBOR is implemented.  For instance, there is no
   requirement that dCBOR implementations support floating point numbers
   (or any other kind of non-basic integer type, such as arbitrary
   precision integers or complex numbers) when they are used with
   applications that do not use them.  However, this document does place
   requirements on dCBOR implementations that support negative 64-bit
   integers and 64-bit or smaller floating point numbers.

2.1.  Common Deterministic Encoding Conformance

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST only emit CBOR conforming "CBOR Common Deterministic
       Encoding (CDE)" [CDE], including mandated preferred encoding of
       integers and floating point numbers and the lexicographic
       ordering of map keys.

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST validate that encoded CBOR conforms to the requirements of
       [CDE].

2.2.  Duplicate Map Keys

   CBOR [RFC8949] defines maps with duplicate keys as invalid, but
   leaves how to handle such cases to the implementor (§2.2, §3.1, §5.4,
   §5.6).  [CDE] provides no additional mandates on this issue.

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST NOT emit CBOR maps that contain duplicate keys.

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST reject encoded maps with duplicate keys.

2.3.  Numeric Reduction

   The purpose of determinism is to ensure that semantically equivalent
   data items are encoded into identical byte streams.  Numeric
   reduction ensures that semantically equal numeric values (e.g. 2 and
   2.0) are encoded into identical byte streams (e.g. 0x02) by encoding
   "Integral floating point values" (floating point values with a zero
   fractional part) as integers when possible.

   dCBOR implementations that support floating point numbers:

   1.  MUST check whether floating point values to be encoded have the
       numerically equal value in DCBOR_INT = [-2^63, 2^64-1].  If that
       is the case, it MUST be converted to that numerically equal
       integer value before encoding it.  (Preferred encoding will then
       ensure the shortest length encoding is used.)  If a floating
       point value has a non-zero fractional part, or an exponent that
       takes it out of DCBOR_INT, the original floating point value is
       used for encoding.  (Specifically, conversion to a CBOR bignum is
       never considered.)

       This also means that the three representations of a zero number
       in CBOR (0, 0.0, -0.0 in diagnostic notation) are all reduced to
       the basic integer 0 (with preferred encoding 0x00).

      |  Note that numeric reduction means that some maps that are valid
      |  CDE/CBOR cannot be reduced to valid dCBOR maps, as numeric
      |  reduction can result in multiple entries with the same keys
      |  ("duplicate keys").  For example, the following is a valid
      |  CBOR/CDE map:
      |  
      |     {
      |        10: "ten",
      |        10.0: "floating ten"
      |     }
      |  
      |         Figure 1: Valid CBOR data item with numeric map keys
      |                           (also valid CDE)
      |  
      |  Applying numeric reduction to this map would yield the invalid
      |  map:
      |  
      |     {  / invalid: multiple entries with the same key /
      |        10: "ten",
      |        10: "floating ten"
      |     }
      |  
      |         Figure 2: Numeric reduction turns valid CBOR invalid
      |  
      |  In general, dCBOR applications need to avoid maps that have
      |  entries with keys that are semantically equivalent in dCBOR's
      |  numeric model.

   2.  MUST reduce all encoded NaN values to the quiet NaN value having
       the half-width CBOR representation 0xf97e00.

   dCBOR decoders that support floating point numbers:

   3.  MUST reject any encoded floating point values that are not
       encoded according to the above rules.

2.4.  Simple Values

   Only the three "simple" (major type 7) values false (0xf4), true
   (0xf5), and null (0xf6) and the floating point values are valid in
   dCBOR.

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST NOT encode major type 7 values other than false, true, null,
       and the floating point values.

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST reject any encoded major type 7 values other than false,
       true, null, and the floating point values.

2.5.  Strings

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST only emit text strings that are in Unicode Normalization
       Form C (NFC) [UNICODE-NORM].

   dCBOR decoders:

   1.  MUST reject any encoded text strings that are not in NFC.

3.  CDDL support, Declarative Tag

   Similar to the CDDL [RFC8610] support in CDE [CDE], this
   specification adds two CDDL control operators that can be used to
   specify that the data items should be encoded in CBOR Common
   Deterministic Encoding (CDE), with the dCBOR application profile
   applied as well.

   The control operators .dcbor and .dcborseq are exactly like .cde and
   .cdeseq except that they also require the encoded data item(s) to
   conform to the dCBOR application profile.

   Tag 201 (Section 6) is defined in this specification as a way to
   declare its tag content to conform to the dCBOR application profile
   at the data model level.  As a result, when this data item is encoded
   using CDE rules, the encoded result will conform to dCBOR also at the
   encoded data item level.  (In conjunction with this semantics, tag
   201 may also be employed as a boundary marker leading from an overall
   structure to specific application data items; see Section 3 of
   [GordianEnvelope] for an example for this usage.)

4.  Implementation Status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   (Boilerplate as per Section 2.1 of [RFC7942]:)

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits the security considerations of CBOR [RFC8949].

   Vulnerabilities regarding dCBOR will revolve around whether an
   attacker can find value in producing semantically equivalent
   documents that are nonetheless serialized into non-identical byte
   streams.  Such documents could be used to contain malicious payloads
   or exfiltrate sensitive data.  The ability to create such documents
   could indicate the failure of a dCBOR decoder to correctly validate
   according to this document, or the failure of the developer to
   properly specify or implement application protocol requirements using
   dCBOR.  Whether these possibilities present an identifiable attack
   surface is a question that developers should consider.

6.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Editor: please replace RFCXXXX with the RFC number of this RFC
   and remove this note.
